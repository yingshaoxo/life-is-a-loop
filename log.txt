"try to install Padavan in redmi ac2100 router"

0. install successfully, but maybe remain openwrt is a better choice; now i'm trying to access it with ssh
1. found that it doesn't have v2ray, all of those devices that I have may got hacked, so I decided to try it again with openwrt
2. I found that padavan is probabally based on openwrt, and it doesn't support v2ray as far as I see. And even if it got Shadowsocks after flash some software, it still not work somehow. So I decided to use switch it back to openwrt
3. got openwrt installed, it has ssh builtin, which is convenient

"try to set up v2ray in openwrt"

0. v2ray is set up in openwrt, but I don't know how to use it to proxy all network
1. but I re-learned more linux commands
2. got luci-app-v2ray set up, but face some problems with the routing sub-pannel
3. successfully set up the routing function, it be able to route all world-class website I defined, for example, google, pornhub, twitter, github and so on
4. the next step is to write about: 1. how to flash openwrt to xiaomi ac2100. 2. how to install opkg package manually.  3. how to install and setup luci-app-v2ray in openwrt
5. write some docs about what I have learned today; i'm going to set up a global proxy in the router level
6. failed, the openwrt was broken, so i have to reset it, and all configs are gone. I need to restart the process. But I learned a new idea, which is, we can use iptables to forward those data directly to a socks5 proxy. I need to verify that
7. by using v2ray dokodemo-door protocol to set up a inbound proxy, with the help of 'uci add firewall', I successfully got a route level proxy; I'll write a POST about it
8. done

"see if we can use UTM's win7 system to unlock xiaomi's bootloader"

0. win7 system install successfully
1. suddently, I think, if we could use wireshark to get the bootloader password from xiaomi's api, then we could just use linux to unlock the phone
2. I didn't make it work, but I found someone did it before: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/possible-new-way-of-unlocking-the-bootloader.4009009; we may unlock the xiaomi phone using some third-party software: https://github.com/mc-17/xiaomi-bootloader/blob/master/README.md
3. I still couldn't make it work on the MacOS I'm using. But I found someone else could make it done by using linux virtual software: https://adryanreis.medium.com/how-to-unlock-bootloader-xiaomi-in-linux-857d2f01128e
4. I coundn't use UTM to unlock the xiaomi's bootloader, it simply because MacOS m1 do not support windows10. But I did another test on Linux virtualbox, where I installed windows10 and miflash tools, it is working pretty good. But one thing you need to do is to install the right android driver. You could do it by installing an app called QuDongJingLing

"see if we can uncompress Nemu android simulator dmg file"

0. as I tested out, we could. by using 7z, I successfully got the ova file from the payload hidden file, it should be able to get running in virtualbox. but since I'm using m1 macos, i decided to convert ova file to something that UTM could run
1. it turns out UTM could directly import the ova file as disk storage. so in theory, utm and virtualbox can excahnge containers. but for this case, since neteast did something to their image, so we couldn't run their android simulator directly from virtualbox

"find out who's unmounting the removeable disk"

0. it turns out is the macos built-in battery manager does it, it will put hard disks to sleep when display is off. in my case, it will poweroff the removeable disk
1. it seems like no one umount the disk anymore. but they directly make the removeable disk disappear, which is worse
2. for most of the case, you can find bad software from launch items, some of them also call it startup apps, or services that gets running at boot time. for macos m1, it is located in /Library/LaunchDaemons or /Library/LaunchAgents
3. oh, if the usb get loaded by another sub-virtual-system, like UTM, it will also get unmounted for somehow

"Run a BBS(website)"

0. by using dev service like heroku, it would be much easyer for us to create a startup website
1. local docker-desktop is broken, I decided to switch to cloud to do the docker image building
2. now we could use docker-compose to run nginx and php code, but coundn't connect to mysql yet, need to figure out why
3. now we could connect to mysql database. and I did an update on geekland's readme file, added an install script. wait to upload to github by using command line tool
4. successfully pushed to github
5. found a new BBS software, but can't directly start it from docker side, I'm doing the 'hack' here
6. learned more about docker and docker-compose, ready for looking for another BBS repo, so that I could have a try on them
7. successfully served the mybb software, now we could create our own Forum
8. I could record a video while install mybb on the server
9. will make a BBS from scrach by myself be an good idea?
10. setted up the BBS under the https: https://bbs.ai-tools-online.xyz; need to change the home page icon
11. icon changed. and I have also removed the verification for user registering

"do some adjustment for the telegram bot system I wrote before to check if a person is a person"

0. found that if I want to make a better golang telegram bot, I have to reuse my old golang package
1. found that I need to add some new functions to the old golang package to make progress
2. found golang 'takes unused variable as error' is a big mistake, it is not a good feature, it should be an optional thing
3. try to recompile golang to remove that limitation
4. if a variable can be detected as unused variable by go compiler, then it can be safely ignored by go compiler automatically, why it requires human to remove it? this is a big bug of golang
5. made a proposal to the golang community: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57073
6. 'go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/v5' is working, 'gorm' is not working as normal so far, need to do a cdeep check tomorrow
7. "gorm is working as expected now.
8. I made a basic version by using golang. but I found there still have a lot of logic needs to be done. the core problem is, we need to delete those garbage messages we generated during the verifying process. And also, we need to delete those messages that was sent by a robot if he/she didn't pass the verifying process
9. Did a fully upgrade to the simple version, now it can delete all those temp messages generated during the verifying process

"make some improvement for 'freedom' app, so it will load and save new notes faster: seprate image data out by creating a new json file or database file. take care of version control, make sure it works on the old data that was generated by older 'freedom' app"

0. did a simple refactoring
1. found a bug on native flutter sqlite module, it can't save a row of data that bigger than 1MB. but you can solve it by using sqflite_common_ffi(https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite/blob/master/sqflite_common_ffi/doc/using_ffi_instead_of_sqflite.md#setup). I think the speed is pretty much acceptable, so I won't change the datastructure for now
2. did another refactoring: use sqlite to speed up the data process; add a lot of loading indicator
3. I think we'd better to let the home page list to have a general loading feature. because it is not a good idea to load every data at once, it will slow down the speed
4. basically made what I suppose to make. the next step is to let the app export only freedom messages (it is an optional choose)
5. new option added

2. I don't have VISA, so I can't go to Singapore for now

"try to improve the auto_everything remove_silence_function by improving the time_intervals function"

0. here is the thinking: we use librosa.effects.split() to get non-silent intervals. for no silence function, we directly concatenate those parts togather. for speed up function, we use [global_start, start1_1]speedup + [start_1,end_1] + ... + [start_n,end_n] + [end_n, global_n]speedup
1. the new functions should be done with the help of numpy
2. finished: use numpy to rewrite the remove silence and speedup silence function
