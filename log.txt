"try to install Padavan in redmi ac2100 router"

0. install successfully, but maybe remain openwrt is a better choice; now i'm trying to access it with ssh
1. found that it doesn't have v2ray, all of those devices that I have may got hacked, so I decided to try it again with openwrt
2. I found that padavan is probabally based on openwrt, and it doesn't support v2ray as far as I see. And even if it got Shadowsocks after flash some software, it still not work somehow. So I decided to use switch it back to openwrt
3. got openwrt installed, it has ssh builtin, which is convenient

3. successfully set up the routing function, it be able to route all world-class website I defined, for example, google, pornhub, twitter, github and so on

5. write some docs about what I have learned today; i'm going to set up a global proxy in the router level
6. failed, the openwrt was broken, so i have to reset it, and all configs are gone. I need to restart the process. But I learned a new idea, which is, we can use iptables to forward those data directly to a socks5 proxy. I need to verify that
7. by using v2ray dokodemo-door protocol to set up a inbound proxy, with the help of 'uci add firewall', I successfully got a route level proxy; I'll write a POST about it

"see if we can use UTM's win7 system to unlock xiaomi's bootloader"

0. win7 system install successfully
1. suddently, I think, if we could use wireshark to get the bootloader password from xiaomi's api, then we could just use linux to unlock the phone
2. I didn't make it work, but I found someone did it before: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/possible-new-way-of-unlocking-the-bootloader.4009009; we may unlock the xiaomi phone using some third-party software: https://github.com/mc-17/xiaomi-bootloader/blob/master/README.md
3. I still couldn't make it work on the MacOS I'm using. But I found someone else could make it done by using linux virtual software: https://adryanreis.medium.com/how-to-unlock-bootloader-xiaomi-in-linux-857d2f01128e
4. I coundn't use UTM to unlock the xiaomi's bootloader, it simply because MacOS m1 do not support windows10. But I did another test on Linux virtualbox, where I installed windows10 and miflash tools, it is working pretty good. But one thing you need to do is to install the right android driver. You could do it by installing an app called QuDongJingLing

0. as I tested out, we could. by using 7z, I successfully got the ova file from the payload hidden file, it should be able to get running in virtualbox. but since I'm using m1 macos, i decided to convert ova file to something that UTM could run
1. it turns out UTM could directly import the ova file as disk storage. so in theory, utm and virtualbox can excahnge containers. but for this case, since neteast did something to their image, so we couldn't run their android simulator directly from virtualbox

0. it turns out is the macos built-in battery manager does it, it will put hard disks to sleep when display is off. in my case, it will poweroff the removeable disk
1. it seems like no one umount the disk anymore. but they directly make the removeable disk disappear, which is worse
2. for most of the case, you can find bad software from launch items, some of them also call it startup apps, or services that gets running at boot time. for macos m1, it is located in /Library/LaunchDaemons or /Library/LaunchAgents
3. oh, if the usb get loaded by another sub-virtual-system, like UTM, it will also get unmounted for somehow

3. now we could connect to mysql database. and I did an update on geekland's readme file, added an install script. wait to upload to github by using command line tool
4. successfully pushed to github

0. found that if I want to make a better golang telegram bot, I have to reuse my old golang package
1. found that I need to add some new functions to the old golang package to make progress
2. found golang 'takes unused variable as error' is a big mistake, it is not a good feature, it should be an optional thing
3. try to recompile golang to remove that limitation
4. if a variable can be detected as unused variable by go compiler, then it can be safely ignored by go compiler automatically, why it requires human to remove it? this is a big bug of golang
5. made a proposal to the golang community: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57073
6. 'go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/v5' is working, 'gorm' is not working as normal so far, need to do a cdeep check tomorrow
7. "gorm is working as expected now.
8. I made a basic version by using golang. but I found there still have a lot of logic needs to be done. the core problem is, we need to delete those garbage messages we generated during the verifying process. And also, we need to delete those messages that was sent by a robot if he/she didn't pass the verifying process

0. did a simple refactoring
1. found a bug on native flutter sqlite module, it can't save a row of data that bigger than 1MB. but you can solve it by using sqflite_common_ffi(https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite/blob/master/sqflite_common_ffi/doc/using_ffi_instead_of_sqflite.md#setup). I think the speed is pretty much acceptable, so I won't change the datastructure for now
2. did another refactoring: use sqlite to speed up the data process; add a lot of loading indicator
3. I think we'd better to let the home page list to have a general loading feature. because it is not a good idea to load every data at once, it will slow down the speed
4. basically made what I suppose to make. the next step is to let the app export only freedom messages (it is an optional choose)
5. new option added

"Use DeepLearning tech to make my OBS recording have better quality, I mean the voice. Here is the basic process: 1. noise cancel. 2. sound match. 3. speech strengthen/beautify"

1. tried 'speechbrain/mtl-mimic-voicebank', it works but only support 16k sample rate, which is not enough.
2. I should try 'Rikorose/DeepFilterNet' or 'facebookresearch/denoiser'
3. 'Rikorose/DeepFilterNet' seems to be good at noise canceling. but it is written by rust. I don't know if it can be  easily integrated into auto_everything or not
4. denoiser doesn't have a pre-trained model that could support sample-rate 48000, so we won't use it

3. it seems like by using shell regex expression function, we could also make a programming language
4. remote set successfully by using anydesk
5. I'll do it when everything seems to be right
6. I think based on golang, I could create a fresh new programming language.
7. There's a project called pytago, I think we could use it to make a new programming language. Here is the process: use python to write a convertor that converts new-programming-language to golang, then compile it
8. before that, we may use python to create a simple interpreter, which people normally call it 'shell'

1. tencent service is still working. and I even add a VPN bridge there by using v2ray
2. we'll continue dev it after 2023.3, because the macos system I am using is not stable, may got hacked from hardware level
3. macos is working normal again; someone contacted me, ask me to develop a audio/video call app, I think I could try to set up a https version server and write a tutorial about it for both that guy and this project
4. the tutorial was quite successful, the next step is to make the demo better, then based on it, upgrade the whole we_love_party project
5. here is the network structure upgrade plan for we_love_party: all service listens 127.0.0.1, only traefik listens 0.0.0.0's 443 port, traefik do a map, convert domain(https url) request to localhost ip request. and for those requests that can't pass the jwt header auth, we drop it
6. add grpc version of user_auth_service; update grpc protocols; add more design ideas
7. find a way to use traefik to proxy grpc
8. "finish the test with traefik forwardAuth and grpc metadata(headers)'s JWT; fix a bug of sqlalchemy;  name, IsJwtOk
9. now we could use traefik forwardAuth middleware to parse JWT into email for every service behind it, so that other service could directly do their own job with an email identity
10. finish the basic version of account user storage system, now the golang service can modify user's data with safety in mind, which means they can only change their own data

17. now I got the basic audio chat app running. the next step is to make tabs to contain more features
18. add tabs bar: party, free map, friends, me
19. use java/kotlin + grpc to make the free map backend service
20. finish the chat service and UI part; need to do a refactory to make sure the real-time function is reliable and sat the meantime, save more power
21. backend code is running in the server now, we need to do more test. and make a backend database management system by using react or vue
