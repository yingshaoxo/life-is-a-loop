"try to install Padavan in redmi ac2100 router"

0. install successfully, but maybe remain openwrt is a better choice; now i'm trying to access it with ssh
1. found that it doesn't have v2ray, all of those devices that I have may got hacked, so I decided to try it again with openwrt
2. I found that padavan is probabally based on openwrt, and it doesn't support v2ray as far as I see. And even if it got Shadowsocks after flash some software, it still not work somehow. So I decided to use switch it back to openwrt
3. got openwrt installed, it has ssh builtin, which is convenient

"try to set up v2ray in openwrt"

0. v2ray is set up in openwrt, but I don't know how to use it to proxy all network
1. but I re-learned more linux commands
2. got luci-app-v2ray set up, but face some problems with the routing sub-pannel
3. successfully set up the routing function, it be able to route all world-class website I defined, for example, google, pornhub, twitter, github and so on
4. the next step is to write about: 1. how to flash openwrt to xiaomi ac2100. 2. how to install opkg package manually.  3. how to install and setup luci-app-v2ray in openwrt
5. write some docs about what I have learned today; i'm going to set up a global proxy in the router level
6. failed, the openwrt was broken, so i have to reset it, and all configs are gone. I need to restart the process. But I learned a new idea, which is, we can use iptables to forward those data directly to a socks5 proxy. I need to verify that
7. by using v2ray dokodemo-door protocol to set up a inbound proxy, with the help of 'uci add firewall', I successfully got a route level proxy; I'll write a POST about it
8. done

1. I think it is kind of hard for me. But you could definately use some tools to simulate the env. For example, v, virtualbox networks, docker networks and so on. (https://www.brianlinkletter.com/open-source-network-simulators
