"try to install Padavan in redmi ac2100 router"

0. install successfully, but maybe remain openwrt is a better choice; now i'm trying to access it with ssh
1. found that it doesn't have v2ray, all of those devices that I have may got hacked, so I decided to try it again with openwrt
2. I found that padavan is probabally based on openwrt, and it doesn't support v2ray as far as I see. And even if it got Shadowsocks after flash some software, it still not work somehow. So I decided to use switch it back to openwrt
3. got openwrt installed, it has ssh builtin, which is convenient

"try to set up v2ray in openwrt"

0. v2ray is set up in openwrt, but I don't know how to use it to proxy all network
1. but I re-learned more linux commands
2. got luci-app-v2ray set up, but face some problems with the routing sub-pannel
3. successfully set up the routing function, it be able to route all world-class website I defined, for example, google, pornhub, twitter, github and so on
4. the next step is to write about: 1. how to flash openwrt to xiaomi ac2100. 2. how to install opkg package manually.  3. how to install and setup luci-app-v2ray in openwrt
5. write some docs about what I have learned today; i'm going to set up a global proxy in the router level
6. failed, the openwrt was broken, so i have to reset it, and all configs are gone. I need to restart the process. But I learned a new idea, which is, we can use iptables to forward those data directly to a socks5 proxy. I need to verify that
7. by using v2ray dokodemo-door protocol to set up a inbound proxy, with the help of 'uci add firewall', I successfully got a route level proxy; I'll write a POST about it
8. done

0. failed, the experiment env is not stable. will keep doing it after I set up routor level VPN
1. I think it is kind of hard for me. But you could definately use some tools to simulate the env. For example, v, virtualbox networks, docker networks and so on. (https://www.brianlinkletter.com/open-source-network-simulators

"see if we can use UTM's win7 system to unlock xiaomi's bootloader"

0. win7 system install successfully
1. suddently, I think, if we could use wireshark to get the bootloader password from xiaomi's api, then we could just use linux to unlock the phone
2. I didn't make it work, but I found someone did it before: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/possible-new-way-of-unlocking-the-bootloader.4009009; we may unlock the xiaomi phone using some third-party software: https://github.com/mc-17/xiaomi-bootloader/blob/master/README.md
3. I still couldn't make it work on the MacOS I'm using. But I found someone else could make it done by using linux virtual software: https://adryanreis.medium.com/how-to-unlock-bootloader-xiaomi-in-linux-857d2f01128e
4. I coundn't use UTM to unlock the xiaomi's bootloader, it simply because MacOS m1 do not support windows10. But I did another test on Linux virtualbox, where I installed windows10 and miflash tools, it is working pretty good. But one thing you need to do is to install the right android driver. You could do it by installing an app called QuDongJingLing

"see if we can uncompress Nemu android simulator dmg file"

0. as I tested out, we could. by using 7z, I successfully got the ova file from the payload hidden file, it should be able to get running in virtualbox. but since I'm using m1 macos, i decided to convert ova file to something that UTM could run
1. it turns out UTM could directly import the ova file as disk storage. so in theory, utm and virtualbox can excahnge containers. but for this case, since neteast did something to their image, so we couldn't run their android simulator directly from virtualbox

"find out who's unmounting the removeable disk"

0. it turns out is the macos built-in battery manager does it, it will put hard disks to sleep when display is off. in my case, it will poweroff the removeable disk
1. it seems like no one umount the disk anymore. but they directly make the removeable disk disappear, which is worse
2. for most of the case, you can find bad software from launch items, some of them also call it startup apps, or services that gets running at boot time. for macos m1, it is located in /Library/LaunchDaemons or /Library/LaunchAgents
3. oh, if the usb get loaded by another sub-virtual-system, like UTM, it will also get unmounted for somehow
